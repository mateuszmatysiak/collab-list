# React Native Reusables Rules

## Context

- For integrating React Native Reusables (shadcn/ui port for React Native)
- Built with NativeWind v4 and @rn-primitives
- Maintains consistency and design standards across mobile platforms

## Requirements

- Import components from `@/components/ui` (or your configured path)
- Keep app-specific components separate from UI primitives
- Match React Native Reusables design and naming conventions
- Remember: React Native lacks CSS cascade - style each Text element directly
- Use Pressable/TouchableOpacity wrappers for interactive elements, not HTML elements
- Add components via CLI: `npx @react-native-reusables/cli@latest add button`

## Available React Native Reusables Components

Alert Dialog, Avatar, Badge, Button, Card, Checkbox, Collapsible, Context Menu, Dialog, Dropdown Menu, Form, Hover Card, Input, Label, Menubar, Popover, Progress, Radio Group, Select, Separator, Sheet (Bottom Sheet), Skeleton, Slider, Switch, Table, Tabs, Text (with typography variants), Textarea, Toggle, Toggle Group, Tooltip, Toast

## Key Differences from Web shadcn/ui

- Uses `<View>` instead of `<div>`
- Uses `<Text>` instead of `<span>` or bare text
- Uses `<Pressable>` instead of `<button>`
- Styling via NativeWind (Tailwind-like) but with React Native limitations
- Requires PortalHost setup for modals/sheets/dialogs
- CSS variables defined in `global.css` and `theme.ts`
