## Frontend

### Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Follow Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/

### Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.

### Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use BiomeJS for consistent code formatting.

### UI and Styling

- Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns and layouts.
- Use [React Native Reusables](https://reactnativereusables.com/docs) with [Nativewind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) for component styling.
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and Expo's useWindowDimensions for screen size adjustments.
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
- Leverage react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations and gestures.
