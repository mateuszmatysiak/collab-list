# React Native

## Safe Area Management

- Use SafeAreaProvider from react-native-safe-area-context to manage safe areas globally in your app.
- Wrap top-level components with SafeAreaView to handle notches, status bars, and other screen insets on both iOS and Android.
- Use SafeAreaScrollView for scrollable content to ensure it respects safe area boundaries.
- Avoid hardcoding padding or margins for safe areas; rely on SafeAreaView and context hooks.

## Performance Optimization

- Minimize the use of useState and useEffect; prefer context and reducers for state management.
- Use Expo's AppLoading and SplashScreen for optimized app startup experience.
- Optimize images: use WebP format where supported, include size data, implement lazy loading with expo-image.
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components with React's Suspense and dynamic imports.
- Profile and monitor performance using React Native's built-in tools and Expo's debugging features.

## Navigation

- Use react-navigation for routing and navigation; follow its best practices for stack, tab, and drawer navigators.
- Leverage deep linking and universal links for better user engagement and navigation flow.
- Use dynamic routes with expo-router for better navigation handling.

## State Management

- Use React Context and useReducer for managing global state.
- Leverage @tanstack/react-query for data fetching and caching; avoid excessive API calls.
- Handle URL search parameters using libraries like expo-linking.

## Error Handling and Validation

- Use Zod for runtime validation and error handling.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Implement global error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors.
